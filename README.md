# DCH-YOLO11

DCH-YOLO11 is an enhanced object detection model based on YOLO11, specifically designed for accurate recognition of multi-symptom citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) leaves under complex field conditions. This project introduces three innovative modules to improve the original YOLO11 architecture, boosting feature extraction, fine-grained recognition, and generalization across challenging scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Three Innovative Modules:**
  - `C3k2_DFF` (Dynamic Feature Fusion): Strengthens interaction between global and local features for better detection of subtle early-stage symptoms.
  - `C2PSA_CAA` (Context Anchor Attention): Focuses on complex leaf vein regions and enhances the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish diverse symptoms.
  - `HDFPN` (High-Efficiency Dynamic Feature Pyramid Network): Optimizes multi-scale feature fusion for robust detection across object sizes.
- **Full Integration**
  - All three modules have been fully integrated into the YOLO pipeline.
  - The core implementation of these modules is located in `ultralytics/nn/Addmodules/`.
  - All new modules are seamlessly fused into the YOLO detection workflow in `ultralytics/nn/tasks.py`.
- **Model Architecture**

- **Dependencies**
  All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt` for easy setup.

## Public Dataset

For full reproducibility, this project supports direct use of the public citrus HLB dataset:

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CdW8/DCH-YOLO11.git
    cd DCH-YOLO11
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the dataset**
    - Download the public citrus HLB dataset ([link](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00001.00947)).
    - Configure the dataset path in the project as described in this README.

4. **Training & Inference**
    - All training and inference code is located in the `ultralytics` directory.
    - The three novel modules are already integrated in `ultralytics/nn/tasks.py`.
    - After configuring the dataset, simply follow the usage instructions in this README to run training or inference and reproduce the main results.
